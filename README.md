# AI Operations Automation Suite

The AI Operations Automation Suite is a portfolio-grade operations platform for a general service business. It is intended to demonstrate how service requests can move from customer intake through validation, AI-assisted interpretation, deterministic routing, human approval, workflow automation, and auditable operational follow-up.

The product remains configurable across service companies instead of assuming a single industry.

## Status

Phase 0 — Product Definition is complete. Phase 1 — Technical Design and Engineering Foundation is underway, with the domain model, lifecycle state machines, API/event contracts, authentication/role policy, persistence/outbox design, and deterministic triage/review policy now defined. Application implementation has not started.

## Implementation honesty

This repository currently contains product and technical-design documentation only. It does not yet contain a working frontend, backend, authentication middleware, database schema or migration, n8n workflow, AI integration, email integration, or deployment. The architecture, lifecycle, API, event, security, and persistence designs described here are proposed rather than implemented.
